# Hi there! 👋 Myself Navyamsh Gangavaram

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a passionate Data Scientist and Analyst with experience in data science, machine learning, and cloud technologies. I love solving complex problems and making data-driven decisions.

**If you ask me why Data Science?**

May 2018, “Dhoni finishes off in style, and Chennai lifts the trophy after seven years.” As a person
who sees the world through the lens of numbers, I used simple calculations and understood that
2011 was the last championship for Chennai super kings. The next day, newspapers were flooded
with details such as runs scored, wickets and the number of catches logged across the season. This
left many unanswered questions, and I trawled to know more about the magic behind such accurate
statistics. **My interest in Cricket also got me interested in its statistics.* However, it was only when
I came across ‘Data science’ that I hit the ultimate jackpot when I realized that what I had viewed
as magic was indeed sorcery, the sorcery of Data scientists. As I kept exploring, I could see how
‘Data Science’ have contributed significantly to creating, maintaining and utilizing
data related across industries.
